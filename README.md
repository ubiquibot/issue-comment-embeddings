# `@ubiquity-os/issue-comment-embeddings`

This is a plugin for [Ubiquibot](https://github.com/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel). It listens for issue comments, and adds them to a vector store. It handles comment edits and deletions as well.

## Configuration
- Host the plugin on a server that Ubiquibot can access.
To set up the `.dev.vars` file, you will need to provide the following variables:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: The URL for your Supabase instance.
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: The key for your Supabase instance.
- `VOYAGEAI_API_KEY`: The API key for Voyage.

## Usage
- Add the following to your `.ubiquity-os.config.yml` file with the appropriate URL:
```yaml
- plugin: https://ubiquity-os-comment-vector-embeddings-main.ubiquity.workers.dev
  with:
    matchThreshold: 0.95
    warningThreshold: 0.75
    jobMatchingThreshold: 0.75
```


## Testing Locally
- Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `yarn worker` to start the server.
- Make HTTP requests to the server to test the plugin with content type `Application/JSON`
